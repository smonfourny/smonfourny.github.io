Hey! I'm Sandrine. I'm a full-stack developer living in Montr√©al, Canada. I studied at McGill University and graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am currently working as a Full Stack Developer at Verto Health. In a previous life, I was a pharmacist.

When I'm not coding, I like to bike, drink IPAs and spend time with my cats.
